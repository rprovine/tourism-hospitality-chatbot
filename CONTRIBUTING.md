## Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define interfaces for component props
- Avoid `any` type when possible

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks

### File Naming

- Components: `PascalCase.tsx`
- Utilities: `camelCase.ts`
- API routes: `route.ts`
- Styles: `kebab-case.css`

### Example Component:

```typescript
interface ButtonProps {
  label: string
  onClick: () => void
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary'
}

export default function Button({ 
  label, 
  onClick, 
  variant = 'primary' 
}: ButtonProps) {
  return (
    <button
      className={`btn btn-${variant}`}
      onClick={onClick}
    >
      {label}
    </button>
  )
}
```

## Testing
