## 📝 Recommendations

1. **Fix Telegram channel validation** - Add frontend check
2. **Update enterprise language display** - Show "All languages" instead of count
3. **Add usage meters** - Visual indicators for approaching limits
4. **Implement hard stops** - Block actions when limits reached (currently allows creation then would fail on use)
5. **Add tier comparison modal** - Quick reference for users
